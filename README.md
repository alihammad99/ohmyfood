# Ohmyfood
Ohmyfood is an online food ordering company.<br>
Our concept allows users to compose their menu<br>
and reduce waiting time in restaurants<br>
because they make their choice in advance.<br>
No more wasting time consulting the menu!<br>


# About the Code
This repository includes three main folders:
- HTML files for the menu are included in the menu folder.
  The Home page is included as 'index.html'.
  
- Scss folder consists of root files, which indicate the variables, nav, and footer.<br>
  I have added them out of the internal folders to reduce repetitive code.<br>
  Internal folders have Scss files for both the Home page and Menu pages.<br>

- CSS folder is the result of Scss compile.<br>

# Scss Package
node-scss is the package that has been used to run scss files.<br>
